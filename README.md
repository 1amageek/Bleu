## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

Add Bleu to your project using Swift Package Manager:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/1amageek/Bleu.git", from: "2.0.0")
]
```

### Basic Usage

#### Create a BLE Server

```swift
import Bleu

// Create a server that responds to device info requests
let server = try await BleuServer(
    serviceUUID: UUID(uuidString: "12345678-1234-5678-9ABC-123456789ABC")!,
    characteristicUUIDs: [UUID(uuidString: "87654321-4321-8765-CBA9-987654321CBA")!],
    localName: "My BLE Device"
)

// Handle incoming requests with type safety
await server.handleRequests(ofType: GetDeviceInfoRequest.self) { request in
    return GetDeviceInfoRequest.Response(
        deviceName: "Bleu Device",
        firmwareVersion: "2.0.0", 
        batteryLevel: 85
    )
}
```

#### Create a BLE Client

```swift
import Bleu

// Create a client to discover and connect to devices
let client = try await BleuClient(
    serviceUUIDs: [UUID(uuidString: "12345678-1234-5678-9ABC-123456789ABC")!]
)

// Discover nearby devices
let devices = try await client.discover(timeout: 10.0)

// Connect to the first discovered device
if let device = devices.first {
    let peripheral = try await client.connect(to: device)
    
    // Send a type-safe request
    let request = GetDeviceInfoRequest()
    let response = try await client.sendRequest(request, to: device.identifier)
    
    print("Device: \(response.deviceName), Battery: \(response.batteryLevel)%")
}
```

## üéØ Advanced Features

### Type-Safe Remote Procedure Calls

Define your communication protocols with full type safety:

```swift
struct GetDeviceInfoRequest: RemoteProcedure {
    let serviceUUID = UUID(uuidString: "12345678-1234-5678-9ABC-123456789ABC")!
    let characteristicUUID = UUID(uuidString: "87654321-4321-8765-CBA9-987654321CBA")!
    
    struct Response: Sendable, Codable {
        let deviceName: String
        let firmwareVersion: String
        let batteryLevel: Int
    }
}
```

### Real-time Data Streaming

Subscribe to continuous data streams with AsyncSequence:

```swift
// Subscribe to temperature sensor data
let temperatureStream = try await client.subscribe(
    to: SensorDataNotification.self,
    from: deviceId,
    characteristicUUID: sensorCharacteristicUUID
)

for await sensorData in temperatureStream {
    print("Temperature: \(sensorData.temperature)¬∞C")
    print("Humidity: \(sensorData.humidity)%")
}
```

### Distributed Actor Communication

Interact with BLE devices as if they were local actors:

```swift
// Get a distributed actor reference to a remote BLE device
let peripheral: PeripheralActor = try await centralActor.connect(to: deviceId)

// Call distributed methods directly
try await peripheral.startAdvertising()
try await peripheral.sendNotification(characteristicUUID: uuid, data: data)
```

### Bluetooth State Monitoring

Monitor Bluetooth state changes reactively:

```swift
let stateStream = Bleu.monitorBluetoothState()

for await state in stateStream {
    switch state {
    case .poweredOn:
        print("Bluetooth ready!")
    case .poweredOff:
        print("Bluetooth disabled")
    default:
        print("Bluetooth state: \(state)")
    }
}
```

## üì± SwiftUI Integration

Bleu provides reactive SwiftUI integration:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import Bleu

struct ContentView: View {
    @StateObject private var bluetoothManager = BluetoothManager()
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            if bluetoothManager.isAvailable {
                Text("‚úì Bluetooth Ready")
                    .foregroundColor(.green)
            } else {
                Text("‚ö†Ô∏è Bluetooth Unavailable")
                    .foregroundColor(.red)
            }
        }
    }
}

@MainActor
class BluetoothManager: ObservableObject {
    @Published var isAvailable = false
    
    init() {
        Task {
            let stateStream = Bleu.monitorBluetoothState()
            for await state in stateStream {
                self.isAvailable = state == .poweredOn
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## üß™ Testing

Bleu includes a comprehensive mock system for testing:

```swift
import Testing
@testable import Bleu

@Test("Mock BLE communication")
func testMockCommunication() async throws {
    let mockSystem = MockBLEActorSystem()
    
    // Setup mock response
    let expectedResponse = GetDeviceInfoRequest.Response(
        deviceName: "Mock Device",
        firmwareVersion: "1.0.0",
        batteryLevel: 75
    )
    
    try mockSystem.setMockResponse(
        expectedResponse,
        for: "getDeviceInfo",
        characteristicUUID: characteristicUUID
    )
    
    // Test the interaction
    let actualResponse = try await mockPeripheral.simulateRequest(
        GetDeviceInfoRequest.Response.self,
        method: "getDeviceInfo",
        characteristicUUID: characteristicUUID
    )
    
    #expect(actualResponse.deviceName == expectedResponse.deviceName)
}
```

## üìã Requirements

## üó∫Ô∏è Architecture

Bleu is built around several key architectural concepts:

### Distributed Actor System
- **BLEActorSystem**: Manages distributed actor communication over BLE
- **BluetoothActor**: Global actor managing Bluetooth state and coordination
- **PeripheralActor**: Distributed actor representing BLE servers
- **CentralActor**: Distributed actor representing BLE clients

### Type-Safe Communication
- **RemoteProcedure**: Protocol for defining type-safe RPC calls
- **Sendable Types**: All data types conform to Sendable for actor isolation
- **Codable Integration**: Automatic serialization/deserialization

### Modern Concurrency
- Full async/await support throughout the API
- AsyncSequence for streaming data
- Actor isolation for thread safety
- Swift 6 concurrency features

## üöÄ Migration from v1

Bleu v2 is a complete rewrite with breaking changes. See the [Migration Guide](MIGRATION.md) for detailed migration instructions.

Key changes:
- Modern Swift Concurrency (async/await) replaces callbacks
- Distributed Actors replace Server/Client classes
- Type-safe RemoteProcedure replaces Communicable protocol
- Minimum deployment targets updated to latest OS versions
