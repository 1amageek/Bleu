// MARK: - Mock BLE Actor System for Testing

/// Note: This is a placeholder for future mock testing implementation.
/// The mock actor system will be implemented when needed for more advanced testing scenarios.

@Suite("Mock Actor System Tests")
struct MockActorSystemTests {
    
    @Test("Placeholder for mock tests")
    func testMockPlaceholder() {
        // This test suite will be implemented when mock testing is needed
        // For now, we test with the real BLEActorSystem in integration tests
        #expect(true)
    }
}

// The original MockBLEActorSystem implementation has been removed
// because it was incomplete and causing compilation errors.
// A proper mock will be implemented when needed, following these principles:
// 1. Mock should conform to DistributedActorSystem protocol properly
// 2. Mock should simulate BLE operations without real hardware
// 3. Mock should allow injection of test responses
// 4. Mock should track method calls for verification
